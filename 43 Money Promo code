Before you opt for a personal loan, you'll want to consider whether there may be less expensive options to borrow money. Some reasons for choosing a personal loan are:

You don't have or couldn't qualify for a low-interest credit card.
The credit limits on your credit cards don't meet your current borrowing needs.
A personal loan is your least expensive borrowing option.
You don't have any collateral to offer.

You might also consider a personal loan if you need to borrow for a fairly short and well-defined period of time. Personal loans typically run from 12 to 60 months.3 So, for example, if you have a lump sum of money due to you in two years but not enough cash flow in the meantime, a two-year personal loan could be a way to bridge that gap.

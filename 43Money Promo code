A personal loan is typically an unsecured loan, which means that the lender does not require collateral—a home or a car, for example—to borrow money. However, with unsecured loans, the lender is taking a greater risk and will most likely charge a higher interest rate than a secured loan. Just how high your rate will be can depend on several factors, including your credit score and debt-to-income ratio.

Some banks offer secured personal loans; the collateral can be your bank account, car, or other property. A secured personal loan may be easier to qualify for and carry a somewhat lower interest rate than an unsecured one. As with any other secured loan, you may lose your collateral if you are unable to keep up with the payments.
